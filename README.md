# Anonymous Chat Room

## Overview
Anonymous Chat Room is a simple Java-based chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and send messages anonymously. Messages are broadcasted to all connected clients in real-time.

## Features
- Multi-client support
- Server broadcasts messages to all connected clients
- Anonymous communication

## How to Run
1. **Start the server:** Run the `ChatServer.java` file on the server.
2. **Start the clients:** Run the `ChatClient.java` file on each client machine.
3. Ensure that both the server and clients are connected to the same network.

## Notes
- The application uses port `8888`. If this port is in use, change the port in the `ChatServer.java` and `ChatClient.java` files.
